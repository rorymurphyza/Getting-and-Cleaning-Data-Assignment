==========================================

##Data Source
The data represented here are drawn from the accelerometers of the Samsung Galaxy 5 smartphone. Original data source is 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip, the data used here is downloaded 03/02/2016.
Orignal code book is found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones, downloaded 03/02/2016;

===========================

##Files
The following files are included in this directory in order to replicate the research:

1. run_analysis.R is the script that will perform the data analysis as well as the tidying of the data. Please refer to CodeBook.MD for the exact operations carried out by this script.
2. CodeBook.MD shows the data transformations that are applied to the data set in order to form the tidy data set.
3. TidiedData.txt is the output of the run_analysis.R script and is included here for comparisons if required. This data set shows the average of each mean or standard deviation measurement foor each subject and each activity.

===========================

##Recreating Research
The tidy data set "TidiedData.txt" generated by this script can be recreated by downloading the above source data file, extracting it and running the script "run_analysis.R" in the same folder.
